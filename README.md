# Bank Term Deposit Subscription Prediction
##  Author: Pol Monné Parera - October 2025

This project aims to find the best supervised machine learning model to predict if a costumer is going to subscribe to a term deposit from a bank based on demographics, financial, and marketing data. The final objective is to be able to use the insights of the data to achieve real business value.

## 📘 Overview of the Data
The dataset contains information about bank clients, their personal and professional attributes, and details about past marketing campaigns.  
Using this data, we build and evaluate machine learning models that can predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.

The data was extracted from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository and corresponds to a portuguese banking institution.
